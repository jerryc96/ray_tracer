# ray_tracer

Simple raytracer in C++.

The ray tracer can render simple spheres with refractive and reflective surfaces.

See image.ppm for an example of the rendered image.

To compile:

`g++ raytracer.cpp`

Future work involve the ability to render other simple shapes (cubes, cones, cylinders), the possibility to extend to transformed
shapes.
